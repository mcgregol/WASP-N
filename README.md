SK8TE is your tool to configure and manage Stryd sensors. Capabilities include player assignment, clock synchronization, hardware identification, and data extraction.

## Prerequisites

 - [WASP Config Utility](https://support.npe.fit/hc/en-us/article_attachments/9893868124308)
 - The WASP device will need to be connected to an existing WIFI network. From this network, you will need to provide the:
    - SSID
    - security type
    - password (if applicable)

> **Note:** If the network does not use DHCP, you will also need a static IP address from the network administrator to assign the WASP to.

## Usage

The WASP has two colored LED lights. If the device is powered on, the **green** light will activate. Any changes to the current state of the device, such as a successful connection to a WiFi network, will activate the **red** light.

The micro USB port located on the side of the device can be used to charge the device by plugging it into a wall, and also to communicate with the device when plugged into a computer.

### Power on the WASP

Press and hold the black button until the red light activates. The green light will activate and continue to flash after the button is released. The WASP is now in **operational mode**.
